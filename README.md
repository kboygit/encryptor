# encryptor
An encryptor or cipher made in ruby

- This is based on Julius Caesar encryption ROT - 13
"ROT-13" is an algorithm that uses a cipher. A cipher is a tool which translates one piece of data to another.
If you’ve ever used a "decoder ring", that’s a cipher. The cipher has an input and an output.
